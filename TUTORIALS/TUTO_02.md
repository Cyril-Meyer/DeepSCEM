# Tutorial 02 : Train your first model

The results of the previous tutorial are required.
In the previous tutorial, we created two dataset, each composed of a single sample with two classes.

## Create a model

In this section we will create a model and explain how to configure it.
First, click on "New model".

This will open the model configuration window.

Here is an explanation for each parameter and how to "choose" it.
* Model dimension : 2D or 3D
  * Do you want your model input and output to be 2D (square patches of slices) or 3D (cube patches) ?
  * Most of time 2D works good (sometimes better than 3D) and are much more lightweight.
  * ðŸ’¡ In our experience, 2D models was always better than 3D ones for organelles segmentation.
* Architecture : U-Net
  * This option is only present for further work (e.g. if someone want to implement its own architecture).
* Construction block : Residual or VGG
  * The residual block add residual connection from the input of each block to the output.
  * ðŸ’¡ Always use residual.
* Kernel size
  * The size of the convolution layer kernels.
  * ðŸ’¡ Do not touch this.
* Initial block filters
  * Number of filters in the first block of filters.
  * Number of filters in the next blocks depends of this values.
    * `initial_block_depth * 2^level`.
  * ðŸ’¡ Use 32 most of time and increase to 64 or 128 for larger models.
* Block per level
  * Number of "processing" (conv + batchnorm) block per level.
  * ðŸ’¡ Do not touch this.
* Normalization : BatchNorm or None
  * Normalization layer to use in the processing blocks.
  * ðŸ’¡ Always use BatchNorm.
* Model depths (levels)
  * The depths of the U-Net architecture (number of time we do max pooling and process with blocks)
  * ðŸ’¡ Reduce to 4 if your model do not fit in memory (e.g. for large 3D models)
* Outputs : locked in safe mode if dataset already loaded
  * Number of ouput (classes)
* Output activation : sigmoid, tanh, linear, softmax
  * ðŸ’¡ Use sigmoid or softmax
    * Using sigmoid allow you to have overlapping segmentations
